# Parrot
This is *simple realization of Parrot* in **Rust Programming Language**.

## How it works
It's very simple. It a *endless cycle*, that takes your *input twice* and say something once, like parrot. *Parrot is a struct* with *function live*, that works all time, what programm is acrive and a *famous frazes vector*. At *first input* the *Parrot learns a new fraze, that you inputed*, *on second you say something* and Parrot interrupt you and *say a fraze from vector with a random index*.

## Build
To build project you need to have installed **Cargo Project Manager** on your device(it usually installs with **Rust Compiler**). If you have it, you can build this project by run these command in terminal(CMD)
> git https://github.com/shrug228/Parrot.git
>
> cd Parrot

**P.S.:** *if you don't have installed git on your PC, you can just download .ZIP archive of this repository to your PC, unarchive it and run the command under this text*.
> cargo build --release
> 
Then you'll get a binary application file in *target/release* with name *Parrot*(or *Parrot.exe*, if you are on **Windows**).
